# NoSQL

This is a challenge on creating a NoSQL database and doing some analysis on it.

## Files in Repository

1. **Resource Folder:** 
   - Contains the JSON file used in the analysis.

2. **NoSQL Setup:**
   - File Name: `NoSQL_setup.ipynb`
   - Description: Provides instructions and code snippets for setting up the NoSQL database using pymongo.
   - Dependencies:
     - pymongo
     - pprint

3. **NoSQL Analysis:**
   - File Name: `NoSQL_analysis.ipynb`
   - Description: Jupyter Notebook containing analysis performed on the NoSQL database.
   - Dependencies:
     - pymongo
     - pprint
     - pandas

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use each file in the repository. For example:

- **Resource Folder:** No action required. Contains the JSON file needed for analysis.
- **NoSQL Setup:**
  - Follow the instructions in the file `no_sql_setup.ipynb` to set up the NoSQL database using pymongo.
- **NoSQL Analysis:**
  - Open the Jupyter Notebook `no_sql_analysis.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.
  - Run each cell sequentially to perform the analysis on the NoSQL database.
